    ##Relationships

    ###Node
    The node that this preprint was created for

    ###Primary File
    The file that is designated as the preprint's primary file, or the manuscript of the preprint.

    ###Provider
    Link to preprint_provider detail for this preprint

    ##Links

    - `self` -- Preprint detail page for the current preprint
    - `html` -- Project on the OSF corresponding to the current preprint
    - `doi` -- URL representation of the DOI entered by the user for the preprint manuscript

    See the [JSON-API spec regarding pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).

    ##Query Params

    + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `provider`
    Most are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.

    ###Creating New Preprints

    Create a new preprint by posting to the guid of the existing **node**, including the file_id for the
    file you'd like to make the primary preprint file. Note that the **node id** will not be accessible via the
    preprints detail view until after the preprint has been created.
