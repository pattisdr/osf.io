Old workflow uses DraftRegistration.registration_metadata and Registration.registered_meta.
New workflow uses DraftRegistration.registration_responses and Registration.registration_responses.

Both workflows need to be accommodated for the foreseeable future, so writing to one field
needs to write to the other field.

Contains "flatten_registration_metadata" for converting from old to new, and
"expand_registration_responses" for converting from new to old.
